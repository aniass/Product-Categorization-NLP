So we pushed the boundaries and maxed out the amount of staining pigments we could blend in with glossy pearls and conditioning vitamin E, so you get a velvety, legendary lacquered finish that stays for a full 8 hours without drying or feeling tacky.Want an even fuller pout? Dab a lighter shade like Pout or Flushed in the center of your lips.
